## Overview👋🏾

Welcome to the first project of the course!

### The project😥

In this project users will be able to:

- Demonstrate understanding of arrays, strings, objects, functions, loops, if/else statements, and more.

## My process💭

<!-- I started by marking out initial classes and in the html file to be later used for styling. I also added images and icons during this step. Next I began styling the css to begin building the visuals. I then added the animation to rotate the page when the navigation bar is opened. I added functionality by way of JavaScript to switch between classes when the user clicks on a button. -->

<!-- Later I brought over the loading animations that I learned while completing the [Blurry Loading](https://github.com/MaianneThornton/50in50_BlurryLoading) project into this project.  -->

### Built with👷🏾‍♀️

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- JavaScript

### What I learned👩🏾‍🏫

<!-- I learned how to add transitions to rotate an entire element. It gave a very unique look to this page. It was very easy to achieve, and I will be applying this method to future projects. -->

### Continued development🔮

<!-- In the future I plan on continuing to practice using different selectors to be more precise when select elements. -->

<!-- I also plan on continuing to learn the best ways to phrase git commits, so that future viewers can fully understand the changes that have occurred. -->

### I'm really proud of these code snippets✂️

<!-- ```css
.container.show-nav + nav li {
  transform: translateX(0);
  transition-delay: 0.3s;
}

nav ul li {
  text-transform: uppercase;
  color: #fff;
  margin: 40px 0;
  transform: translateX(-100%);
  transition: transform 0.4s ease-in;
}
``` -->

### Useful resources📖

<!-- - [Resource](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-write-better-git-commit-messages/) - This is an amazing article which helped me write better commit messages. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept. -->
